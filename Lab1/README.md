# Anthropology 2202 - Spring 2022

## Labs 0 and 1

### Lab 0 Instructions

This course assumes some previous experience in GIS. While we will review basic aspects of data models in the first four weeks, the learning curve will seem somewhat steep if you have never worked with GIS before. The first part of this assignment is therefore an in-class exercise designed to evaluate whether you have the requisite background to take the course. 

#### Assignment

In the team remaining in class, using your program of choice (ArcGIS Pro, QGIS or R), MAKE A MAP OF BROWN’S CAMPUS. Then, fill out the referenced google form. Your map should incorporate the following elements:

1. A basemap of your choice
2. A shape file containing the buildings on Brown’s campus, downloaded and unzipped from the class canvas website
3. A scale bar
4. A north arrow
5. A legend
6. A text box formatted to include the following information: 
	.. 1. A listing of the map projection
	.. 2. Specification of the total number of square meters covered by Brown University Buildings, ON COLLEGE HILL (i.e, not including the medical campus, school of public health, or football stadium)

**HINT** - one of the challenges in part 6 of this exercise is that the attached shapefile attribute table does not contain a column listing the areas of each building footprint. *You will need to create one.*

## Lab 1 Instructions / Deliverables

_Wednesday, February 2nd, 11:59 pm_: Turn in a NEW VERSION of the same map you produced in class, but render it one of the other two programs that you did NOT choose to use. 

_Challenge_ - Visit the RIGIS website and access the “Hurricane Surge Inundation Areas (Worst Case) for Providence County.” Overlay Brown University’s buildings atop this layer. Calculate what percentage of campus building (by number, not area) intersect the storm surge regions.
